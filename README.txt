SNAKE V1.0 Documentation

This program has been made by Baptiste Delaporte. It is a snake game developped in C++ and using the SDL, SDL_images and SDL_ttf libraries.
I guess there's no need to remind you of the rules anyways..

I am just going to explain how to navigate between the different menus:

The main menu is divided in 4 sections which are "Game", "Settings", "HighScore" and "Edit Map".
You can reach one of these sections by pressing the UP and DOWN arrow keys of your keyboard and then pressing the RETURN key to launch the considered section. Press the ESCAPE key to exit a section or a subsection.

Here is a quick review of each sections:

*Game: This section launches the game itself. You can have a break while you are playing by pressing the SPACE key.
IMPORTANT: I advise you to avoid changing directions too fast (<10ms) otherwise, the snake may sometimes go backward way too fast and eat itself and consequently, you will lose the game. I am still trying to fix this problem. Recent updates will come soon enough.

*Settings: This section launches the settings menu which is also divided in 4 subsections where you can either choose who is going to play, or choose the skin, the speed of the snake and the wallpaper. The navigation between these different subsections is the same as the main menu.

*Highscores: This section displays the top three highscores of the game.

*Edit Map: Create your own map and you will never get bored of this game! You can exit this subsection only once you have set the position of the snake. Use the RIGHT and LEFT arrow keys to choose between the wall and the snake, choose a location with the mouse/pad and then click on the left button of your mouse/pad to set the objet on the map. 
(Use the right button of the mouse/pad to erase the objet). You can set and erase walls faster by keeping the left button down.

Enjoy !
